                    Instead of runnning processes in sessions, we are better off if we use a text editor to write code and then feed the file as input. This input file is known as a script.

                        As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that youâ€™ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.

                    <p>
                          To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module .

                          Modules are a way to structure a program and create reusable libraries

                  <p>
                      A module is usually stored in and corresponds to a separate .py file. Many modules are available from the standard library. You can create your own modules if needed.
