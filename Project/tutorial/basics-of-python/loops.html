              A loop statement executes a statement or group of statements multiple times.

            <h3><strong>Types of Loops:</strong></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>While Loop:</b>
                    <p>
                        Repeats a statement or group of statements as long as a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>For Loop:</b>
                    <p>
                        Executes a sequence of statements  a given number of times and abbreviates the section of code that manages the loop variable.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Nested Loops:</b>
                    <p>
                        You can nest a loop within another loop to execute different actions on a hierarchial basis.
                    </p>

            <h4><strong>Loop Control statements</strong></h4>
            <p>
                Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence.
                When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.
