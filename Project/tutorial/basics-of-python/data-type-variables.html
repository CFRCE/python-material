                    <p>
                        They are often called just integers or ints, are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.

                    <p>
                        Also called longs, they are integers of unlimited size, written like integers and followed by an uppercase or lowercase L.

                    <p>
                        Also called floats, they represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E or e indicating the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 102 = 250).

                    <p>
                        Complex Numbers are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are floats and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number). The real part of the number is a, and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.

                    <b>Strings:</b>
                    <p>
                        Strings are amongst the most popular types in Python. We can create them simply by enclosing characters in quotes. Python treats single quotes the same as double quotes. Creating strings is as simple as assigning a value to a variable

                        <pre>
                            var1 = 'Hello '
                            var2 = "var1 = 'Hello World!'

                            print "Hello World!"
                        </pre>

                    <b>List</b>
                    <p>
                        The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type.
                        Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated values between square brackets.
                    </p>
                    <div class="well well-sm">
                      <pre>
                          list1 = ['Math', 'French', 1942, 2003];
                          list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
                          list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
                      </pre>

                    <b>Tuples</b>
                    <p>
                        A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.

                        Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. Optionally you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also.
                    </p>
                    <div class="well well-sm">
                      <pre>
                          tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);
                          tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );
                          tup3 = "a", "b", "c", "d";
                      </pre>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Dictionary</b>
                    <p>
                        Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, like this: {}.

                        Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
                        For those of you already familiar with JSON, you might feel right at home.
