          <h3><strong>String Operations</strong></h3>
          <div class="well well-sm">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Equality</b>
                    <p>
                        Two strings are equal if they have exactly the same contents, meaning that they are both the same length and each character has a one-to-one positional correspondence. Many other languages compare strings by identity instead; that is, two strings are considered equal only if they occupy the same space in memory. Python uses the is operator to test the identity of strings and any two objects in general.
                    </p>
                    <pre>

                        >>> a = 'hello'; b = 'hello' # Assign 'hello' to a and b.
                        >>> a == b                   # check for equality
                        True
                        >>> a == 'hello'             #
                        True
                        >>> a == "hello"             # (choice of delimiter is unimportant)
                        True
                        >>> a == 'hello '            # (extra space)
                        False
                        >>> a == 'Hello'             # (wrong case)
                        False

                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Numerical</b>
                    <p>
                        There are two quasi-numerical operations which can be done on strings -- addition and multiplication. String addition is just another name for concatenation. String multiplication is repetitive addition, or concatenation. So:
                    </p>
                    <pre>

                        >>> c = 'a'
                        >>> c + 'b'
                        'ab'
                        >>> c * 5
                        'aaaaa'

                    </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Containment</b>
                    <p>
                        There is a simple operator 'in' that returns True if the first operand is contained in the second. This also works on substrings
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        >>> x = 'hello'
                        >>> y = 'ell'
                        >>> x in y
                        False
                        >>> y in x
                        True
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Note that 'print x in y' would have also returned the same value.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Indexing and Slicing</b>
                    <p>
                        Much like arrays in other languages, the individual characters in a string can be accessed by an integer representing its position in the string. The first character in string s would be s[0] and the nth character would be at s[n-1].
                    </p>
                    <pre>
                        >>> s = "Xanadu"
                        >>> s[1]
                        'a'
                    </pre>
                </li>
