              They are immutable data types, means that changing the value of a number data type results in a newly allocated object.

             Python supports four different numerical types âˆ’

             <li>
                 <b>int (signed integers):</b>
                 <p>
                     They are often called just integers or ints, are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.
                 </p>
             </li>
             <li>
                <b>Long (long integers ):</b>
                <p>
                    Also called longs, they are integers of unlimited size, written like integers and followed by an uppercase or lowercase L.
                </p>
             </li>
             <li>
                 <b>Float (floating point real values) :</b>
                 <p>
                     Also called floats, they represent real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E or e indicating the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 102 = 250).
                 </p>
             </li>
             <li>
            <b>Complex (complex numbers) :</b>
            <p>
                Complex numbers are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are floats and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number). The real part of the number is a, and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.
